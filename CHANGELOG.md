#### Breaking changes:

* [(#23)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/23) Moved Session pooling functionality to 
`QldbDriver` and removed `PooledQldbDriver`.
* [(#28)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/28) Removed interfaces which allow developers to 
get a session from the pool and execute transaction.
* [(#29)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/29) Renamed `QldbDriver` property `pool_limit` to 
`max_concurrent_transactions`.
* [(#30)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/30) Removed `QldbDriver` property `pool_timeout`.
* [(#31)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/31) Moved method `list_tables` to the driver 
instance
* [(#27)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/27) Removed `retry_indicator` 
from `QldbDriver.execute_lambda`.
* [(#27)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/27) Moved `retry_limit` from `QldbDriver` to 
`RetryConfig`.
 [(#34)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/34)  Removed `QldbDriver.execute_statement`.

#### New features:

* [(#27)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-python/issues/27) Added support for defining custom retry 
backoffs.

#### Announcements 

* Dropping support for Python v3.4 and v3.5. Going forward the minimum Python version required will be v3.6 for Pyqldb 3.x 
series.


### Release 2.0.2 (May 4, 2020)
* Added `Getting Started` and `Cookbook` to public API docs.

### Release 2.0.1 (March 18, 2020)

* Fixed README to reflect the correct minimum python version required.
The driver requires Python 3.4 or later, earlier it was mentioned to be 3.x

### Release 2.0.0 (March 11, 2020)

#### New features:
* Added Execute methods to PooledQldbDriver
* Added support for python native types for [execute_statement](https://amazon-qldb-driver-python.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0/reference/session/pooled_qldb_session.html#pyqldb.session.pooled_qldb_session.PooledQldbSession.execute_statement) parameters

#### Unavoidable breaking changes:
* In order to be more pythonic, the method signature of [execute_statement](https://amazon-qldb-driver-python.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0/reference/session/pooled_qldb_session.html#pyqldb.session.pooled_qldb_session.PooledQldbSession.execute_statement) has 
been changed to receive *args. This is a breaking change for any application 
that uses 1.0.0-rc.2 version of the driver. Starting v2.0, applications should 
pass execute_statement parameters as comma separated arguments instead of passing them as a list.

### Release 1.0.0-rc.2 (October 29, 2019)

* Fixes for small documentation issues.

### Release 1.0.0-rc.1 (October 28, 2019)

* Initial preview release of the Amazon QLDB Driver for Python.
